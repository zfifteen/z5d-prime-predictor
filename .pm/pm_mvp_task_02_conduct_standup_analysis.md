### Task 2: Conduct Stand-Up Analysis

Your task is to perform a high-level **status + commentary** review of this repository. Answer the three core stand-up questions **and** add directional insight (what it means, where to steer next).

1. **What was accomplished since the last report?**
   * Note recently merged PRs/closed issues and key bench/build results.
   * State why each item matters for performance, correctness, release readiness, or tooling stability.

2. **What are we working on now?**
   * Summarize active PRs/issues and current investigation threads.
   * Identify the primary goal each item serves (e.g., faster benches, more reliable builds, packaging/docs).

3. **What are our current impediments?**
   * Call out blockers or risks (build failures, missing data, dependency/version gaps, unclear decisions).
   * Suggest one plausible mitigation or next step when possible.

4. **Directional Commentary (short, but opinionated):**
   * Trajectory: are we moving toward the next milestone? If not, why?
   * Next 1–2 bets to maximize momentum.
   * Decisions/owners needed (if any) and recommended timing.

Hold your findings in memory. Once you have clear answers, proceed to the final task file: `pm_mvp_task_03_publish_report_and_exit.md`.
