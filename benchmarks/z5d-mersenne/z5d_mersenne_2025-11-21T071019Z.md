# z5d-mersenne: All scenarios locked a prime with modest windows and sub-3s wall-time up to 1e1000

This run benchmarks the centered nearby-prime search (z5d-mersenne) across Sanity, Mid, and Large scales. We fixed MPFR precision and MR rounds per the plan, used auto-tuning with wheel 210, and recorded candidates (MR calls), max/final window, R, and wall-time. Each case achieved prime_count=1 (locked=true), indicating the tuner reliably finds a nearby prime without excessive window growth.

Methods: Apple Silicon build, MPFR precision 2048 bits, MR rounds 8, auto-tune enabled, wheel=210. For each k, we captured iteration logs to compute the maximum window reached and extracted final parameters and timings from the program output. Success rate across the 14 scenarios was 100%.
