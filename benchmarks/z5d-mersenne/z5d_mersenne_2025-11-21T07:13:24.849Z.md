# z5d-mersenne smoke: All scenarios locked a nearby prime with fixed precision 2048 and MR rounds 8

We ran z5d-mersenne with auto-tuning and wheel 210 across Sanity, Mid, and Large k values, capturing candidates (MR calls), max/final window, R, wall-time, and lock status, per BENCHMARKS.md. Each row in the CSV represents one k scenario.

Methods: Apple Silicon, MPFR precision 2048 bits, MR rounds 8, max iters 500, auto-tune on. We parsed the tool's verbose output to compute window_max from tuning iterations and extracted final parameters and timings.

See z5d_mersenne_2025-11-21T07:13:24.849Z.csv for the detailed results.
