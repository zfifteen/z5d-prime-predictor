# User Prompt Artifact

**Date Created:** 2025-11-22  
**Section:** Title Page (Section 1 of White Paper)  
**Task Type:** Documentation Creation

---

## Original User Request

The user requested the creation of a white paper for the Z5D Prime Predictor project. The specific instructions for this task were:

### Issue Title
"White Paper Outline: The Z5D Prime Predictor – A Geodesic Approach to Efficient Large Prime Estimation"

### Primary Task
Create a new folder in the repo root called "whitepaper". In this new directory, create sub-directories for each section of the draft whitepaper.

### Specific Instructions for Section 1
Create the first section - Title Page.

Put this title page in its own subfolder (as per instructions). In this folder, create artifacts for any and all internal and external references. Also create an artifact for the user prompt that initiated this task. Create another artifact that meticulously documents your reasoning. err on the side of too much information. Include all thoughts - make no judgement regarding relevance.

Finally, create another artifact that documents your reasoning in executing this task - certainties, uncertainties, your view on how the remaining sections of the white paper should be accomplished and any other extraneous thoughts that occurred while you're reading this instruction.

## Key Constraints

1. **Narrow Scope**: Focus exclusively on the nth prime prediction algorithm and its C implementation (z5d-predictor-c module)
2. **No Factorization**: Exclude extensions to factorization or Mersenne scanning
3. **Platform Specific**: Apple Silicon optimization (macOS only)
4. **Page Target**: 10-15 pages total
5. **Documentation Focus**: Mathematical synthesis and implementation, drawing from validated project resources
